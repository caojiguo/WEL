# Weighted Empirical Likelihood Inference for Dynamical Correlations

This folder consists of coding for two simulation studies and three applications.

1. WEM1.R: the R code for the simulation study with the proposed weighted empirical likelihood method under the irregular design;

2. WEM2.R: the R code for the simulation study with the proposed weighted empirical likelihood method under the regular design;

3. BS1.R: the R code for the simulation study with the bootstrap method under the irregular design;

4. BS2.R: the R code for the simulation study with the bootstrap method under the regular design;

5. no2_2000.csv, pm25_2000.csv: the air pollutant data;

6. AirPollution.R: the R code for analyzing the air pollutant data with the proposed methods.

7. C5C3P8.RData: the EEG signal data; 

8. EEG.R: the R code for analyzing the EEG signal data with the proposed methods.

9. gene58rep34.txt: gene expression data;

10. gene.R: the R code for analyzing the gene expression data with the proposed methods.

11. scel.R, CI.R, CIwt.R: These three files are some R functions used for our proposed method.
